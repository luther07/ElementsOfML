## Exercise 4.2.4:
Read a file of characters, treating it as a sequence of words,
which are sequences of consecutive non-white-space characters.
Each word is followed by either a single white space character
or the end-of-file, so two or more consecutive whate spaces
indicate there is an empty word between them. Return a list of
the words in the file.
